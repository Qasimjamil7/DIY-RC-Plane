# DIY-RC-Plane

This RC Plane project uses foamboard and RC components to build a lightweight airplane. Controlled via RF, the plane includes servo-based control surfaces and a brushless motor for thrust. Perfect for hands-on learning of aerodynamics and remote systems.

ðŸ”© Components Used:

Foamboard or Thermocol Sheet (for body)
Brushless Motor + Propeller
ESC
9g Servo Motors (x2â€“3)
Li-Po Battery
RF Transmitter & Receiver (e.g., FlySky FS-i6)
Control Horns, Linkages
Hot Glue Gun, Carbon Rods (for structure)
